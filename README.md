A platformer that I started (but didn't finish) for Ludum Dare 43.

The theme for this Ludum Dare was “Sacrifices must be made”. In Molotov Madness, the sacrifices are meant to be the Molotovs. They were designed to be the most powerful and most needed weapon in the game, but also the only thing that can restore the health of your delectate player (who’s called Jeff, by the way). Drinking Molotovs also gets you drunk.
So the player is meant to strike a balance between using the limited Molotovs to fight, and to keep the player alive (and drunk).
I started the game during Ludum Dare, and even continued a bit afterwards, but it doesn’t look like I’ll finish. It’s simply not fun enough to make, unfortunately! Nice design concept, but boring execution.

So for now, I’ve decided to discontinue development indefinitely.
